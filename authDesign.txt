LOGIN - JWT - ACCESS TOKEN - REFRESH TOKEN

1. When we login, server provides an access token and a refresh token. The validity or existence time period 
of access token is less than that of refresh token. 

2. Access token is provided in JSON format, refresh token is provided in the form of cookie with {httpOnly: true},
in order to make it a bit more secure and is inaccessible to JS. Access tokens are directly provided to the user
whereas refresh token is stored in DB for further use.

3. We can access notes/data only with the help of a valid access token.

4. Once the validaity of access token is over we can get a new access token with the help of our refresh
token. We check for refresh token in cookies validate with the refresh token stored in DB. Once validated 
successfully, the server provides a new access token.

LOGOUT

1. When we logout we can delete the access token in frontend and remove refresh token from database, now user can't
access data or notes. We can again access our data with the help of a successfull login
